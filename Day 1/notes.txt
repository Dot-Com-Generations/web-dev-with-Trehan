Front End Web Dev -> The UI and the feel of the website

Whatever the client/user sees in a website is Front End.

Basic Front End -
    1. HTML -> Bones/Structure
    2. CSS -> Skin/Style
    3. JS -> Muscles/Nerves/Interactions
    4. CSS Frameworks/Libraries
    5. JS Animations/Libraries

HTML -> HyperText Markup Language

Boilerplate -> this is the bare minimum code required to start.

<!DOCTYPE html> -> This declares that our file is an HTML5 Document
<html lang="en"> -> html tag defines the opening of your webpage


<head> -> the brain of your html file
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>


<body>
    This is visible on the screen
</body>
</html> -> this marks the ending of the html file.


HTML contains Tags/Elements
<tag>

Tags are of two types
    1. Dependent -> 
    <tag>
            Your Code goes here
    </tag>
    2. Independent ->
    <tag>
    <tag /> *Best Practise

Attributes
-> Attributes are available on every HTML Element/tag

<tag attribute="value"></tag>
<tag attribute="value" />

Each tag is categorized in two ways -
    1. Block Element
        -> It will cover the whole avilable width.
    2. Inline Element
        -> It will only take up the width equal to it's content.
